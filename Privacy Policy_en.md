Welcome to Let's Shake (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). We take your privacy seriously, especially when it comes to the safety of child users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

Name, email, phone number
Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, AAID)
Geolocation data
Any user-generated content (e.g., recordings, photos)
The App operates entirely offline. All data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to any server.

## 2. Childrenâ€™s Privacy (COPPA Compliance)
The App does not collect any data from users under 13, complying with COPPA (Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR-K (EU Childrenâ€™s Data Protection Regulation).

No social media integration
No ad tracking
No third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)

## 3. Third-Party Services
The App does not use any third-party SDKs (e.g., ads, analytics, or social logins), meaning no data is shared with external companies.

All data (e.g., preferences, game progress) is stored locally on your device (iOS Keychain/Android SharedPreferences).
